        <p>Print Media is a rule for how a web page will look when it's being printed, typically with Print Media you want to have easy to read styling that wont take up large
        amounts of ink and has unessentials things removed such as links or navigation. Print Media is done using Media Queries which we will cover later on, this topic will focus
        on what is essential and non-essential for Print Medias and best practices around it.</p>

        <h1>Homework:</h1>
        <p>Homework for this week is to create a responsive design site using Media Queries, you must also include a Print media style using
        some of the best practices. (ie. Remove background colors, navigation, any URL's that wouldn't be clickable). Use Media Queries to create
        a design that is readable and easy to navigate for mobile or tablet. Use any of the resources provided above to achieve this.<br><br>
        Tips: Using %'s for your widths makes them scale easily without too much fuse, layer navigation on top of each other rather than inline for
        easier to click on mobile.</p>
